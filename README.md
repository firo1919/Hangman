This is a simple console-based implementation of the classic game Hangman. The game randomly selects a word from a list of words, and the player must guess the word by entering letters one at a time. The player has a limited number of guesses before the game is over.

## Getting Started

To play the game, simply run the `Hangman.java` file in your Java IDE or terminal. The game will start immediately.

## How to Play

1. The game will randomly select a word from a list of words.
2. The player must guess the word by entering letters one at a time.
3. If the player guesses a correct letter, that letter will be revealed in the word.
4. If the player guesses an incorrect letter, a part of the hangman will be drawn on the screen.
5. The player has a limited number of guesses before the game is over.
6. If the player correctly guesses the word, they win the game. If they run out of guesses, they lose the game.

## Customization

The game uses a list of words that can be customized by editing the `words.txt` file in the `src` directory. Each word should be on a separate line.
